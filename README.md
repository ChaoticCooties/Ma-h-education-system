# Ma+h education system (ABANDONED)
This broken piece of software has since been submitted as an assignment (as much as I hate it) and will no longer be developed due to spaghetti code and a language I'm not interested to work further on --> PHP. Refer to the upcoming MERN stack quiz web application which will include deployment for demoing.

> A web development project done with PHP/HTML/CSS/Javascript/Unity
